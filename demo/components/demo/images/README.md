Avatars are used to provide a visual representation of context. An image can be circular or rectangular, depending on usage and could vary on size.

Use a figure to include an image, optionally with a caption. They should not be used with icons or logos.
Use `nglCrop` to the parent element of the image to apply cropping to the specified ratio.
