Pills are a way of visualizing options that have originated from free text.

If `(nglPillRemove)` event is set, then the the `X` remove button will appear. If you still want to explicitly define button's visibility you can do it via `[nglPillRemovable]`.

Use the `nglPillImage` attribute on an element that is going to be the icon before the pill's label.
